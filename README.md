# Shopify FE Intern Challenege

## Overview

This is a short app to interact through text chat with the OpenAI.  It demonstrates use of React, Javascript, Object Oriented Programming and accessibility. The app features the ability to favorite responses, delete response, as well as view all favorited responses on a separate page.  

## Deployed Web App

## Technologies Used

- ES6 JavaScript

- HTML
- React and React Router
- POST requests

## Future Features

- Although I was able to succesfully utilize the environmental variables on my local machine once on github the Api key was flagged. I would like to have time to make it work correctly and not have a workaround.
