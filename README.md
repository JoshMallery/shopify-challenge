# Shopify FE Intern Challenege

## Overview

This is a short app to interact through text chat with the OpenAI.  It demonstrates use of Fetch Requests, Object Oriented Programming and accessibility. The app features the ability to favorite responses from the AI as well as Delete responses from the AI.


## Technologies Used

- ES6 JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- REACT
- POST requests

## Future Features

- Adding additional favorite functionality to give the ability to go to a separate page that only shows favorited responses.
- Although I was able to succesfully utilize the environmental variables on my local machine once on github the Api key was flagged. I would like to have time to make it work correctly and not have a workaround.
